•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I try to write code with no mistakes and try to keep it efficient. Overly wordy code seems to increase the risk that I make some kind of error that needs to be found and corrected. Junit testing is also a great way to check code for functionality. You can use this to test to make sure that the program will operate the way it is intended to operate.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs should be described to the development team to ensure that they can be properly planned for before any code is written. This will help prevent the development team from having to go back and change things later on, which is a very costly process, both from a time and monetary perspective.

•	How do I approach designing software?

My approach to writing code is to try to take my time and write the best code I am capable of writing. I am still very new to coding, so my best isn’t as good as what others are capable of yet, but I am hopeful that will change with time and more experience.
